# Unsupervised Learning Project: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction on Iris Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of unsupervised learning techniques applied to the Iris dataset. The project focuses on:

- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Clustering**: Applying K-Means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings in the data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using PCA and t-SNE for visualization of high-dimensional data in two dimensions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing clustering quality through Silhouette Scores.
- **Deployment and Monitoring**: Discussing practical considerations for deploying and maintaining clustering models in production.

## Project Structure

- `Assignment 9: Unsupervised Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code, visualizations, and detailed explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
